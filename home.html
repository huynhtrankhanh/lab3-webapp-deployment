        <h2>Hello, my name is Huỳnh Trần Khanh</h2>
        <p>I am passionate about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. I want the two nations to live in peace together.</p>
        <p>There are many political paths to peaceful coexistence, most of them can be categorized into the two-state solution and the one-state solution.</p>
        <p>No matter what our political and religious beliefs are, we have to acknowledge that the status quo is not just and a severe humanitarian crisis is ongoing.</p>
        <p>Watch the video for the history of the conflict:</p>
